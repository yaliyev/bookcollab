Very good, Lestrade,” said Holmes, laughing. “ You _ really are very fine indeed. Let me see it.” He took up the paper in a listless way, but his attention instantly became riveted, and he gave a little cry of satisfaction. ‘“ This is indeed important,” said he.

“Ha! you find it so?”

“Extremely so. I congratulate you warmly.”

Lestrade rose in his triumph and bent his head to look. “Why,” he shrieked, “ you’re looking at the wrong side !”

“On the contrary, this is the right side.”

“The right side? You're mad! Here is the note written in pencil over here.”

“And over here is what appears to be the fragment of a hotel bill, which interests me deeply.”

“There’s nothing in it. I looked at it before,” said Lestrade. ‘ ‘Oct. 4th, rooms 8s., breakfast 2s. 6¢., cocktail 15., lunch 2s. 6d., glass sherry, 8d.’ I see nothing in that.”

“Very likely not. It is most important, all the same. As to the note, it is Senan oe also, or at least the initials are, so _ I congratulate you again.”
