Now a pawnbroker’s business is mostly done of an evening, Mr. Holmes, especially Thursday and Friday evening, which is just before pay-day; so it would suit me very well to earn a little in the mornings. Besides, I knew that my assistant was a good man, and that he would see to anything that turned up.

“¢That would suit me very well,’ said I. ‘And the pay?’

“*Ts £4 a week.”

“¢ And the work ?”

“¢Ts purely nominal.”

*«¢What do-you call purely nominal ?’

- “Well, you have to be in the office, or at least in the building, the whole time. If you leave, you forfeit your whole position forever. The will is very clear upon that point. You don’t comply with the conditions if you budge from the office during that time.’

“¢Tt’s only four hours a day, and IJ should not think of leaving,’ said I.

“¢No excuse will avail,’ said Mr. Duncan Ross, ‘neither sickness nor business nor anything else. There you must stay, or you lose your billet.’
